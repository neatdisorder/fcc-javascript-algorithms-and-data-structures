### freeCodeCamp Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

This is a single-page application I created for showcasing the solutions for the five final projects developed in vanilla Javascript for the **freeCodeCamp Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification** of the [freeCodeCamp curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn).

The projects included are:  
1. Palindrome Checker  
2. Roman Numeral Converter  
3. Caesar's Cipher  
4. Telephone Number Validator  
5. Cash Register  

This was created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. For the design I followed [freeCodeCamps' Style Guide](https://design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org/).
